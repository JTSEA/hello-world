Figuring this out

OK, this change is editing a new branch of the readme.

Then saving it is called a "commit".

But that's just saving the branch, not yet changing the master.

Cool, that worked. So to force a carriage return in the display,

(at least for plain text), requires two CRs in the editor.

The preview changes pane will have a red bar to left of anything deleted,

and in green next to new lines or changes.
